# music-dl

A simple script that simplifies downloading music from youtube and embedding it with the correct metadata.

## Dependencies

- [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/)
- [beets](https://beets.io/)

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/mrSpooder/music-dl ;
cd music-dl/ ;
sudo make install ;`

## TODO

- Handle query options. (Ex: music-dl -A 'mer de noms' [URL])
- Maybe handle removal of music from library, although that can be done with beets.
- Adjust tags before handing file over to beets.
